# Foundation-Jekyll

A Bare Bones [Foundation][1] & [Jekyll][2] site starting point that doesn't assume anything.

### Version
Current - 1.0.0

## About
This repo was created as a starting point to use [Foundation][1] & [Jekyll][2] to create static websites. There aren't many (if any) [Foundation][1] & [Jekyll][2] scaffolds, so I created one. This repo is geared more towards building static sites, not just a blog. Hopefully you'll find it as useful as I do.

### Get Started
Clone the repo and start building your site:

```
 git clone git@github.com:aaronkwhite/foundation-jekyll.git project-name
```

The core components are located in the *source* directory, so you can better organize your content and stucture.

This repo is using [Foundation][1] [Sass][3] & Font-Awesome [Sass][3], located in the root directory. You'll need to setup [Compass][4] or use [Codekit][5] to compile the [Sass][3] into the `source/assets/stylesheets` directory.

To test your site locally just run:

```
jekyll serve
```

*Note:* Make sure you update your git remote before you try to push any changes.

### Dependencies
 - Jekyll
 - Foundation 5
 - Sass Compiler
