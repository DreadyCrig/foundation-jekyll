    <h3>Get Started</h3>

      <p>Clone the repo and start building your site:</p>

      {% highlight shell-session%}
        $ git clone git@github.com:aaronkwhite/foundation-jekyll.git project-name
      {% endhighlight %}


      <p>The core components are located in the source directory, so you can better organize your content and stucture.</p>

      {% include layout.html %}

      <p>
        We're using Foundation &amp; Font-Awesome Sass compiled by Jekyll automatically when we build the source. All Sass files are located in the '_scss/' directory including the customized skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary stylesheet  '/assets/stylessheets/style.scss' file is configured to include all necessary files for Foundation, Font-Awesome and your custom styles.
      </p>

      <p>To test your site locally just run:</p>

      {% highlight shell-session%}
        $ jekyll serve
      {% endhighlight %}
