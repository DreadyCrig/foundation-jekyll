      This boilerplate was created as a starting point to use Foundation &amp; Jekyll to create static websites. There aren't many (if any) Foundation &amp; Jekyll boilerplates, so I created one. The structure is geared more towards building static sites and prototypes, not just blogs. Hopefully you'll find it as useful as I do.
